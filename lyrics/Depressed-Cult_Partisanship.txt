"It's not that they don't give a damn, it's that they've just given up. The social problems they are faced with just seem to enormous to deal with."
"Ah, that only makes things worse. Causing people to suffer because you hate them is terrible, but causing people to suffer because you have forgotten how to care - that is really hard to understand."
People are being manipulated
For the elite's gain.
Prison's filled with criminals
Of non-violence!

No victim, who's to blame?
Blindly following,
Slave to public servants,
While corruption reigns free.

Everything you know is a lie,
Propaganda thick in the sky.
Morals boiled down to party line,
Cast aside cult-partisanship.

Join the anti-cause!
Join the anti-cause.
Surely all can see,
Sick fucks reign supreme.

Corporations running rampant;
Forced degredation trip.
To strip humanity
Of it's sanity.

Wall Street short sales and
Derivatives inflate their market.
Money created out of nothing.
Backed by our government.
You don't trust these orgs,
But trust their spokesmen.
Fuck the DNC and the GOP too.

Everything you know is a lie,
Propoganda thick in the sky,
Morals boiled down to party line,
Cast aside cult-partisanship.

Quoting "us vs them."
Soldiers for their sport
Rivalry, with your family!
Child sex ring.
Cold war with Beijing.
Blow the world up for oil.
Brainwashed our own soil.
Cruelty normalized.
Oppression accepted.
Political dominance.
Freedom enforced.

"They'll remember. It will take some time and it won't be easy."
