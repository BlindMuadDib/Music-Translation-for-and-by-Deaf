Mountains, where I belong
Can't slip into the nowhere song.
All along you've been dragging me,
Dragging me into your nothing law.
Home, I can't seem to find,
Someone bring me,
To where I belong.

I'll make is myself,
I'll battle to the bone.
Just want a home,
One for me, and share with you.

Time to sleep,
Done for now,
Wish to know your love, if only just once.
Told is don't exist
But know even you. can be, past skin deep.
