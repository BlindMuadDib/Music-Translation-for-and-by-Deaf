The wanderer; always crawling,
Your life emptying, burning around you.
Watched them all fall, to learn;
Staying and going is all the same,
The only way out is to give it all
The only way out is to not go inside.

No more! No more!
I can't stay here til I rot away!
No more! No more!
I can't stand to watch you take it all away!

I don't need you to pretend.,
Another day gone in my mind,
Another lifetime about to begin.
I'll catch the wind and we'll meed up on the other end.

No more! No more!
I can't stay here til I rot away!
No more! No more!
I can't stand to watch you take it all away!

Blacking out, can barely stand,
Dying in this time of waiting.
Bread filling my cup, drowning in my light.
Help me survive, drowning by my side.
